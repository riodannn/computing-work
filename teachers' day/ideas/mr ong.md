 When I first heard that, I was astonished! </br>
 Why was a teacher telling a joke? Aren't we suppose to learn? "Because they make up everything!" came the

 "HAHAHAHHA!" I laughed so hard my stomach hurt. </br>
 Then came another one"Why is nitrogen the most excited element. Because N2! N2! N2!" That was a really good pun on the number of nitrogen atoms in a nitrogen atom.
